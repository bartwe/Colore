We have redesigned Colore's website (the site you're viewing right now) to
be a bit more featured and include a blog!

We're not sure how frequent we'll be posting updates, but at least we now
have a definite place where we can broadcast news about Colore.

The site is generated using [Jekyll][], and hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghp].
This means it is also completely open source! You can browse the site source
on the [`gh-pages` branch on the Colore repo][branch].

[ghp]: https://pages.github.com/
[branch]: https://github.com/CoraleStudios/Colore/tree/gh-pages
