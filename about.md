# About&hellip;

Colore is a C#/.NET library for interacting with [Razer's Chroma SDK][csdk].
It is written in the latest 6.0 specification of C# and aims to be intuitive
to use and similar in architecture to other popular .NET libraries.

[Adam Hellberg][adam] and [Brandon Scott][brandon] are the main developers
and creators of the library. [Other developers][contribs] have since taken
interest in the project and contributed valuable code to further improve the
project.
